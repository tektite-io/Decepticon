"""Neo4j-backed storage for the skillogy service.

Replaces the in-memory ``SkillRegistry`` (deleted in Amendment v0.2.2
along with ``ingest.py`` — there were no live importers left after the
REST app was rewritten). The server opens a Bolt session to the Neo4j
instance that ``skillogy.builder`` populates via ``skills.cypher``.

The wire protocol is the new three-operation surface
(``find_skill`` / ``load_skill`` / ``traverse``) plus
``query_moc_summary`` — see ``server/app.py``.

Read-only enforcement
---------------------
Server-driven Cypher (``run_cypher_read`` RPC, Phase 1b-onwards
``recall``) is the obvious attack surface. The backend enforces three
defenses, layered: ``default_access_mode=READ`` on the Bolt session
(server-side), AST-style keyword denylist applied to the inbound
``query`` string (belt-and-suspenders), and a per-query parameter cap
+ row-count cap so a malformed query can't exhaust the agent context.
