"""Skillogy server: Neo4j-backed REST app for Phase 1a (Amendment v0.2.2).

The legacy in-memory ``SkillRegistry`` and the markdown ``ingest_directory``
helper were removed; their files (``registry.py`` and ``ingest.py``) are
kept for one release as no-import-graph dead code so anyone importing
the old names sees a clean ``ImportError`` from this package instead of
a stale class. See ``docs/design/skillogy-brain-redesign.md`` Amendment
v0.2.2 for the rationale.
