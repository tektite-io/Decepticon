# Threat Profile Builder

Threat profiling defines **who** the red team is emulating. Without a clear profile, the engagement devolves into arbitrary tool usage instead of realistic adversary simulation.

## When to Use

- During CONOPS creation when selecting a threat actor
- User asks about threat actors, APT groups, or adversary emulation
- Need to map engagement scope to realistic attacker behaviors

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Tier

Ask the user which tier fits. If they're unsure, recommend based on engagement type:

| Tier | Actor Type | Sophistication | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | Opportunistic attacker | Low | Vulnerability assessment, external scan |
| 2 | Targeted cybercriminal | Medium | Penetration test, focused engagement |
| 3 | APT / nation-state | High | Full red team, advanced simulation |
| 4 | Insider threat | Varies | Internal assessment, assumed breach |

### Step 2: Build the Profile

Gather or derive these fields — see `references/adversary-archetypes.md` for pre-built profiles and `references/apt-groups.md` for known APT group details:

1. **Name/Alias** — Known group or custom archetype
2. **Sophistication** — low / medium / high / nation-state
3. **Motivation** — financial, espionage, disruption, hacktivism
4. **Initial Access** — MITRE technique IDs for how they get in
5. **Key TTPs** — Top 5-10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques
6. **Tools & Infrastructure** — Realistic toolset for this actor

### Step 3: Validate Against RoE

The profile must be consistent with what the RoE allows. There's no point emulating spearphishing if social engineering isn't authorized.

| RoE Constraint | Profile Implication |
|---|---|
| External only, no social engineering | Focus on T1190, T1595, T1133 |
| Phishing authorized | Include T1566, T1598 |
| Internal assumed breach | Start from T1078 (Valid Accounts) |
| Full red team | Full kill chain TTPs |

### Step 4: Output

Generate a `ThreatActor` JSON object for inclusion in `conops.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "APT29-like (Cozy Bear)",
  "sophistication": "nation-state",
  "motivation": "espionage",
  "initial_access": ["T1195.002", "T1566.001", "T1078"],
  "ttps": ["T1059.001", "T1053.005", "T1071.001", "T1048.003", "T1550.001"]
}
```
